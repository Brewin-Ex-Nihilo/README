# BEN Project Standards and Guidelines

### **_ Purpose _**

Brewin' Ex Nihilo ("BEN") was created for my husband, who loves to play D&D but does not want to sink months and months of prep time into 'homebrewing' his own campaigns. Thus, I came up with the idea of a highly complex app with hundreds of moving parts that could generate endless amounts of content at the click of a button to help fill in the gaps of depleted creative wells.

My extended vision for BEN is to streamline the creation process under the 'Campaign' tab. Ultimately, this will allow the user to generate and customize an entire story setting, output that information to a printable PDF, and then be able to take that pre-formatted file to a vanity press and print their own hardbound adventure's guide.
